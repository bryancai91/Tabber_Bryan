## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
1. Allows for users to key in specific tip amounts

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. Not a design kind of guy, so design was hard for me.
2. NSUSerDefaults is difficult to debug
3. The Simulator doesn't run to scale, making aligning of items extremely difficult'
